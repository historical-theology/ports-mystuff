BibleTime is a completely free Bible study program.

It contains over 200 free Bible texts, commentaries, dictionaries, and 
books, provided by the Crosswire Bible Society via the 
SWORD programming library. 

BibleTime is written in C++ and uses the Qt GUI toolkit. 

This port for OpenBSD has been submitted upstream as a
slightly edited version of what is used in the
Aprendiendo de Jesus OpenBSD-based distribution
(aprendiendo.pasosdejesus.org).
It was made originally by Vladimir Tamara Patino
(vtamara@pasosdeJesus.org).
