Known Issues
============

The current implementation of wdfs-fuse for OpenBSD has a number of shortcomings
the user should be aware of.

Performance
-----------
WebDAV FUSE implementations are known to be very slow with certain file
managers. The reason is that graphical file managers often try to crawl the
remote file tree in advance or read the remote files in an attempt to find out
their type. Since network connections are slower than local access, this results
in a sluggish experience.

It is therefore recommended to only use file managers which don't try to
preemptively access big parts of the WebDAV storage at once. For example,
Midnight Commander offers OK performance.

In addition, wdfs does not implement all the system calls you would expect from
a filesystem. This may cause some desktop programs to work erratically when
trying to save files to a WebDAV FUSE mount. LibreOffice is a known offender.

Security Implications
---------------------
The FUSE implementation included in OpenBSD only allows root to mount and
unmount FUSE filesystems. For this reason, wdfs must be executed by the
superuser. At this time, wdfs does not feature privilege separation of any kind
and cannot drop to a less privileged state after being launched. The unfortunate
implication is that wdfs will run a lot of network code with high privileges.

Should a malicious WebDAV server exploit a vulnerability in wdfs or its
supporting libraries, the attacker could gain root access. It is therefore
advised to use wdfs to connect to trusted servers only.

Example Usage
=============

To mount a NextCloud account under /home/joe/mnt and allow access to user joe,
whose uid is 1000:

# mkdir /home/joe/mnt
# wdfs https://server.example.org/remote.php/webdav/ \
> /home/joe/mnt -o allow_other -o uid=1000
