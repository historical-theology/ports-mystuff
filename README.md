# Corey Stephan's OpenBSD Ports (ports/mystuff)

This is my personal set of OpenBSD ports. They will be at different stages of stability at different points in time. I hope that the final destination for them will be the official OpenBSD Ports Tree.

### Current Status (May 5, 2023)

#### ACCEPTED into Ports Tree
* [SWORD](https://crosswire.org/sword/index.jsp) from the [Aprendiendo de Jesus [adJ] project's own /ports/mystuff/ directory](https://gitlab.com/pasosdeJesus/adJ/-/tree/main/arboldes/usr/ports/mystuff) -- Successfully ACCEPTED into OpenBSD Ports Tree as textproc/sword

#### Working but not in Ports Tree
* [BibleTime](https://bibletime.info/), a Qt-based GUI for SWORD, also from the [Aprendiendo de Jesus [adJ] project's own /ports/mystuff/ directory](https://gitlab.com/pasosdeJesus/adJ/-/tree/main/arboldes/usr/ports/mystuff) -- easily compiles
* [wdfs](https://github.com/jmesmon/wdfs), a webdav filesystem, from Ruben Llorente with edits by Yifei Zhan (in [this ports@openbsd.org thread](https://marc.info/?t=165280470800002&r=1&w=2)) -- easily compiles

#### Other
I also intend to work on [Kvantum](https://github.com/tsujan/Kvantum), which I have compiled without hassle in OpenBSD, and a few other projects. 

This repository is going to change over time.
