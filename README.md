# Corey Stephan's OpenBSD Ports (ports/mystuff)

These are my OpenBSD ports. They will be at different stages of stability at different points in time. I hope that the final destination for them will be the official OpenBSD Ports Tree.

The first two ports that I have included are [sword](https://crosswire.org/sword/index.jsp) and the Qt-based frontend for it called [BibleTime](https://bibletime.info/) from the [Aprendiendo de Jesus [adJ] project's own /ports/mystuff/ directory](https://gitlab.com/pasosdeJesus/adJ/-/tree/main/arboldes/usr/ports/mystuff). I am respecting the adJ team's hard work by duplicating the exact ISC license file from that repository here. My work on those two ports is basically to clean them (slightly) so that they compile properly on 'raw' OpenBSD before ultimately submitting them upstream.

I also intend to work on [Kvantum](https://github.com/tsujan/Kvantum), which I have compiled without hassle in OpenBSD, and a few other projects. This repository, therefore, is likely to change with time.
